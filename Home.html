            </h1>
        <p>
            Since its inception in 1959,  the Department of Physics has kept pace with developments in advanced areas in the discipline, the introduction of a three year M.Sc.  (Tech.)  in  Photonics, Electronics and Instrumentation Technologies in Engineering Physics course with specialisations reflecting that mindset. Such courses aim to develop professionals who are versatile and conversant with the needs of the industry. Admissions to the course are made through an All India Entrance Test - Joint Admission Test for  M.Sc.  (JAM) .  Apart from its regular coursework,  the course includes  Industrial  Training of eight weeks and six months of Project Work/Dissertation in various reputed  R&D Organizations and industries. The Department strives to provide a balanced blend of both   Science and Engineering curriculum and hands-on training for students. The course curriculum is upgraded regularly in keeping with the ever-changing needs and demands of the industry.
